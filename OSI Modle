The OSI model.
The Open Systems Interconnection model
Network Protocol Layering Models In the very beginning of the computer networking era, only computers from the same vendor could communicate with each other because of the different standards (or lack of standards) being used by different vendors. In the late 1970s, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) created a reference model of Open Systems Interconnection (OSI). The protocols in the OSI model are organized into seven layers. Each layer is a group of related protocols that collectively (or alternatively) solve one part of the whole problem. Any two layers are placed next to each other based on which parts of the problem they solve and how those parts are related to each other. OSI is a very good theoretical model, and TCP/IP (the implementation of it) is the most practical system ever built closest to this model.
